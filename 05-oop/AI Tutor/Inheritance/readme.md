# Next Step: 
1. Polymorphism:
 Explore how you can override methods in child classes and how to use polymorphism effectively. for instrance, you could override the `study()` method in `GraduateStudent` to include some additional behavior. 

2. Interfaces and Abstract Classes: 
 Learn how interfaces and abstract classes can help you define a common structure for classes that share similar behavior but might have diffrent implementations. 

3. Design Patterns: 
 Look into some design patterns such as the Factory pattern or Singleton pattern to see how OOP can solve common problems in software design.
